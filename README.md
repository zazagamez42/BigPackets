# [ info ]

Too lazy to type anything here but long story short the owner makes cheats since atleast 2014 and they are still shit, nowadays he also makes cheats for singleplayer games/games that nobody cares about (Killing Floor, Fallout, Contagion) and sells them

The owner is maybe actually schizophrenic (has 2 different personalities online), honestly wouldn't be surprised if thats the case (thats what you get for playing gmod for 10+ years)

Take a look at his website [here](http://bigpackets.com/)

# [ how-to ]

You're gonna need to get a DLL injector, [Xenos](https://github.com/DarthTon/Xenos) will do you just fine (VAC detected though)

**NOTE**: If you're injecting into GMOD you should opt out of any betas and start the x86 version of the game

</div>

1. Download any cheat you want from the [releases page](https://github.com/PlutoSolutions/BigPackets/releases)
0. Open your desired game, add the DLL to the injection list, select the game process (GMOD/TF2/CSS/Synergy -> hl2.exe, L4D2 -> left4dead2.exe, GTASA -> gtasa.exe), press inject while being on the main menu
0. Press INSERT and DELETE, click login on the login screen and its gonna let you through

Configs are saved in the `naebengine` folder in your game's folder
